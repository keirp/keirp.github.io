I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/) and [Sheila McIlraith](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/). I am also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

In 2023, I was a student researcher at Google working on data efficiency for LLMs with the Gemini and Blueshift teams.

My research interests lie in AI reasoning and decision-making. Research highlights include:

- **Automatic prompt engineering** (resulting in a popular [prompting trick that gives insight into the psychology of GPT](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1624847051426234368)).
- **OpenWebMath**, a dataset of all the mathematical documents on Common Crawl, and **Llemma**, the best open language model for mathematical reasoning.
- **STEVE-1**, a Minecraft agent that can follow visual and text instructions using only keyboard and mouse commands.
