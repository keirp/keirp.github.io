I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/) and [Sheila McIlraith](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/). I am also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

My research interests are in the intersection of decision-making and sequence modeling. In particular, can the same probabilistic sequence modeling approach used for ChatGPT and image captioning be used to *plan*, *act*, and *reason*? What are the limitations of this approach compared to other methods for sequential decision-making such as reinforcement learning? Can we leverage these insights in combination with powerful, pretrained sequence models to create generalist models that can surpass the performance of the data they are trained on and contribute positively to human capability and knowledge?

<!-- My research journey started during my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I worked with Pieter Abbeel and Sergey Levine on multi-agent reinforcement learning. When I started my PhD, I became interested in how simple sequence modeling approaches can be used in place of reinforcement learning. In my research on the topic, I discovered an [explicit relationship between optimal planning and sequence modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02419), explored the limitations of such an approach in [stochastic environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15967), and created a [state-of-the-art agent for Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00937) which can follow text instructions and solve a variety of tasks in the game. -->
