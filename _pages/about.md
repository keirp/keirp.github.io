I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/) and [Sheila McIlraith](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/). I am also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I am currently a student researcher at Google, working on large language models.

<!-- My research interests are in the intersection of decision-making and sequence modeling. In particular, can the same probabilistic sequence modeling approach used for ChatGPT and image captioning be used to _plan_, _act_, and _reason_? What are the limitations of this approach compared to other methods for sequential decision-making such as reinforcement learning? Can we leverage these insights in combination with powerful, pretrained sequence models to create generalist models that can surpass the performance of the data they are trained on and contribute positively to human capability and knowledge? -->

My research interests lie in AI reasoning. Research highlights include:

- **Automatic prompt engineering** (resulting in a popular [prompting trick that gives insight into the psychology of GPT](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1624847051426234368)).
- **OpenWebMath**, a dataset of all the mathematical documents on the web, and **Llemma**, the best open language model for mathematical reasoning.
- **STEVE-1**, a Minecraft agent that can follow visual and text instructions using only keyboard and mouse commands.
